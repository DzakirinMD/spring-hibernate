# spring-hibernate

IDEA: 
A simple Spring app
* App that can do CRUD (financial sector can do deposit, widthrawn)
* Will have CRUD
* Deploy to heroku
* Create a flowchart(If have time)

Tech stack:
* Spring 5 -> 5.2.9.RELEASE
* Tomcat 9 -> because spring 5 does not compatible to the new Tomcat 10 (new package renaming from javax.* to jakarta.*)
